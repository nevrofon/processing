In GIMP
1: Add jpg as layer (just drag it)
2: Layer -> Scale layer... (to half the size)
3: Reposition to find interesting spot (fb cover is in the down/right region)
4: Filters -> Blur -> Zoom motion blur... (find x/y, blurring factor 0.022)

Apply twice:
5: Filters -> Edge-Detect -> Edge... (algorithm: differential, amount to taste)
